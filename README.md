#  How Kate Spent the Day

#### Author : Kate Byars

## Description
_Today I split my day between following up with a recruiter that requested a meeting earlier this week and making a self-study guide for the project I would like to execute (it may need to become an Android app, or part of it can move to an app later): An app that queries my Instagram account and puts locations into Google API so I can have a personalized map on my own "Kate Travels" site, which pairs with my Instagram travel photography account, @katebyars.
